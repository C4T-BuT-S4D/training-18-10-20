attack plan

1. add weapon to sell queue
2. make race condintion to lock market file and get a little piece of time to set weapon as main
3. now we sell our weapon, but g_user->current_weapon is our sold weapon
4. When we sell weapon, we free( wp ) and get a new struct for weapon entry in market
5. New struct has same size as struct weapon
6. So we have a g_user->current_weapon wich points to market_entry
7. In struct market_entry first field is pointer to owner name
8. When we unset weapon, item is added to weapon list, and his qualitit is now equal a DWORD of pointer to owner name
9. now we can sell this weapon again and get a lot of coins
